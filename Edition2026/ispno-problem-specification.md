# IMIC 2026 Contest: Intelligent Spare Parts Network Optimization (ISPNO)

## Industrial Context

The problem emerges from collaboration between academic researchers and manufacturing industry partners facing critical spare parts management challenges. Modern manufacturing facilities operate complex equipment requiring 500+ unique spare parts, with unplanned downtime costs ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 per hour. The challenge addresses the fundamental trade-off between inventory holding costs ($2-5M annually) and equipment availability (target 95%+ uptime).
