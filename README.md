# Benchmark 9. Intelligent Manufacturing International Contest: IMIC

**Website under construction !**

## Motivations & Ambitions
The smart manufacturing community lacks of a suitable, comprehensive, and standardized benchmark for real industrial cases in manufacturing.
This type of tools is however highly needed to compare quantitatively academics proposals based on representative case studies of industrial systems and identify areas of improvement.
Given the time and effort required to build such a benchmark, the fundamental approach at the heart of the IMIC is to foster progressive collaboration among the scientific community over time.
To do so, the IMIC aims, each year, to propose a manufacturing problem submitted to the community in a form of a student/researcher academic competition. 
Results of the contest will then be considered as candidate solutions of the proposed problem, and will be compared and archived as a new benchmark instance.
In a couple of years, IMIC is expected to become a reference benchmark for the community.
