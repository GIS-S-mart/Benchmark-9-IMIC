  * 4 files *.dat, whose specifications and usages is detailed in the problem presentation.

  The procedure to launch the simulator is the following :
  
  1. Open the simulation model. To open it, you'll need to download and install Flexsim version 24.0 or higher. Refer to the question [How can I get Flexsim?](#Flexsim-intallation) for more info.
  2. Once opened, you'll need to launch the flexsim model. If you don't know how to do it, we recommend you to make at least the beginner tutorials available when launching Flexsim.
  3.  When you start the program, four windows will pop up one after the other, asking you to pick four *.dat files. You can tell which file to choose by looking at the window title (top left) or the file type (bottom right). see the figure below for a graphic explanation.
